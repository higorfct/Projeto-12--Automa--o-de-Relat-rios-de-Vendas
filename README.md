# 📊 Project 12: Sales Report Automation  

## 🧠 Business Context  
The fictitious company **Comercial Pereira**, operating in the clothing retail sector, manually collects daily sales data recorded in Excel spreadsheets by its stores.  
An administrative employee spends, on average, 1 hour per day to:  
- Consolidate the data  
- Create sales charts  
- Write a summary by salesperson, state, and product sold  
- Generate and format a PDF report  
- Attach and send the email to regional decision-making managers  

This process is repetitive, costly, error-prone, and consumes valuable work time.

## 💸 Financial Impact  

Assuming an average cost of **R$ 30/hour** for the responsible employee:  
- **Daily cost of the manual process:** 1 hour ≈ R$ 30/day  
- **Monthly cost (22 business days):** R$ 30 × 22 = R$ 660  
- **Approximate annual cost:** R$ 660 × 12 = **R$ 7,290**  

With the Python automation, the entire process is executed in **less than 10 seconds**, with no human intervention.

## ✅ Direct Results of the Automation  
- Estimated annual savings: **R$ 7,000+**  
- More reliable and standardized reports  
- Immediate availability of information for decision-making  
- Scalable to multiple stores and regions
